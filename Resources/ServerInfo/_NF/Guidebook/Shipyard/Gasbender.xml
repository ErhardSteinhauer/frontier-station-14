  # Tips on running LVHI Gasbender shuttles
  - Gasbender comes equipped with five APC units that can be used to appraise the ship's total power consumption. Unmodifued and with thermo-machines off-line Gasbender requires 40 kW of power to remain operational. For more general info on power grid see guidebook article [textlink="Power" link="Power"].
  - Gasbneder is expedition capable shuttle and although it's primary purpose is gas collection, it doesn't exclude more dangerous exdeavours. For more information about expeditions see [textlink="Expeditions" link="Expeditions"].
