  # Dinosaurs
  
  Enigmatic behemoths from a bygone era known for their imposing stature and formidable presence. It would seem that nature "chose" to go the same way on some distant planets as it did on Earth once.
  
  Can be butchered for meat.

  # Known variants
  # "Compsognathus"
  
  Compsognathus is a genus of small, bipedal, carnivorous theropod dainty dinosaur. Compsognathus are small, bipedal animals with long hind legs and longer tails, which they used for balance during locomotion. The forelimbs were smaller than the hindlimbs.

  It is a large carnivore that could reach over 9 metres (30 ft) long and weigh over 5 metric tons (5.5 short tons), and are able to move as a biped and a quadruped. Are known for their range of bizarre head adornments, which are likely used for communication and increased hearing.

  # "Kentrosaurus"
  
  Kentrosaurus generally measure around 4–4.5 metres (13–15 ft) in length as an adult, and weight about 700–1,600 kilograms (1,500–3,500 lb). It walks on all fours with straight hindlimbs. It has a small, elongated head with a beak used to bite off plant material (or miner's linds) that would be digested in a large gut. It has double row of small plates running down its neck and back. These plates gradually merged into spikes on the hip and tail.

  # "Triceratops"
  
  Bearing a large bony frill, three horns on the skull, and a large, four-legged body, exhibiting convergent evolution with bovines and rhinoceroses, Triceratops is one of the most recognizable of all dinosaurs and the best-known ceratopsian. It is also one of the largest, measuring around 8–9 metres (26–30 ft) long and weighing up to 6–10 metric tons (6.6–11.0 short tons).

  # "Ankylosaurus"
  
  Ankylosaurus is estimated to be between 6 and 8 meters (20 and 26 ft) long and weight between 4.8 and 8 metric tons (5.3 and 8.8 short tons). It is quadrupedal, with a broad, robust body. It has a wide, low skull, with two horns pointing backward from the back of the head, and two horns below these that pointed backward and down. The front part of the jaws is covered in a beak, with rows of small, leaf-shaped teeth farther behind it. It is covered in armor plates, or osteoderms, with bony half-rings covering the neck, and had a large club on the end of its tail.

  # "Spinosaurus"
  
  Spinosaurus reaches 14 metres (46 ft) in length and 7.4 metric tons (8.2 short tons) in body mass. It has large, robust forelimbs bearing three-fingered hands, with an enlarged claw on the first digit. The distinctive neural spines of Spinosaurus, which are long extensions of the vertebrae (or backbones), grew to at least 1.65 meters (5.4 ft) long and are likely to have had skin connecting them, forming a sail-like structure.

  # "Stegosaurus"
  
  Large, heavily built, herbivorous quadrupeds with rounded backs, short fore limbs, long hind limbs, and tails held high in the air. Due to their distinctive combination of broad, upright plates and tail tipped with spikes. The function of this array of plates and spikes has been the subject of much speculation among scientists. Today, it is generally agreed that their spiked tails were most likely used for defense against predators, while their plates may have been used primarily for display, and secondarily for thermoregulatory functions.

  # "Tyrannosaurus"
  
  It is a bipedal carnivore with a massive skull balanced by a long, heavy tail. Relative to its large and powerful hind limbs, the forelimbs of Tyrannosaurus are short but unusually powerful for their size, and they had two clawed digits. Tyrannosaurus could exceed sizes of 13 m (43 ft) in length, 3.7–4 m (12–13 ft) in hip height, and 8.8 tonnes (8.7 long tons; 9.7 short tons) in mass.
