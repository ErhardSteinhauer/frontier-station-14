  They can [color=#ffa500]only[/color] eat meat and fruits, but can eat raw meat and drink blood without any ill effects.

  Their small stature allows goblins to dive into toilets and mailing units.
  
  Their unarmed attacks deal Slash damage instead of Blunt.

  Due to their unusual dietary choices goblins take [color=green]20% less Toxin damage[/color], but because of their small size they take [color=#ffa500]10% more Brute (Blunt/Slash/Piercing) damage[/color].
