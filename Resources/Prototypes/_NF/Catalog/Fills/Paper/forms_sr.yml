        Issuing outpost command:
        [bullet]XXXXXXXX, Station Representative
        [bullet]XXXXXXXX, Sheriff

        This document authorizes captain XXXXX XXXXXXX of vessel XX-XXX to assist and cooperate with NFSD and Frontier authorities in neutralizing hostile threats to Frontier that bluespace into its space. These include, but are not limited to:
        [bullet] Cultist vessels
        [bullet] Syndicate vessels
        [bullet] Wizard vessels
        [bullet] Arcadia Ind. vessels

        This document does NOT deputize you or grant you special privileges within the ranks of NFSD to arrest, detain, and prosecute employees of Frontier Station. [bold]Any contraband seized during your operations aboard any hostile vessel must be turned into either NFSD or the Station Representative's office for a cash bounty. Keeping any articles of contraband will lead to forfeiture of this agreement, and you may be liable to be charged with various crimes.[/bold] Keep a copy of this document on you at all times. Remember to maintain contact with either NFSD command or the Station Representative in order to minimize casualties.

        Should NFSD be present, a staging area will be designated to allow for better coordination. Your staging area is three hundred (300) metres away from the hostile vessel, between the hostile vessel and Frontier Outpost. Depending on the circumstances of the shift, [bold]this can change.[/bold] Please stay in regular contact with both NFSD command and the Station Representative's office for updates on a staging area.

        This is a formal declaration from Frontier's Station Traffic Controller, hereby declaring the vessel [italic] XX-XXX [/italic] to be abandoned by its captain, and recognized as salvage.
