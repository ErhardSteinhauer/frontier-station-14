        This is a formal declaration from Frontier's Station Traffic Controller, hereby declaring the above vessel to be abandoned by its captain, and recognized as salvage. Your vessel has been unresponsive on the radio for over twenty (20) minutes and has either not responded to written faxes, or is unable to receive faxes from Frontier. Henceforth, this office deems it fit to declare it as salvage.

        Pursuant to Space Law §9.3, this vessel will be moved out to three hundred (300) meters from Frontier Station by a Valet or NFSD, and will be salvageable by any other vessel operating within Frontier's space.

        Neither Frontier Station nor the Nanotrasen Corporation will reimburse any party affiliated with this vessel for losses incurred.
